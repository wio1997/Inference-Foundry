## 最近 Loop

共 `50` 个 Loop；完整索引见 `loop-index.jsonl`。

| Loop | 状态 | 结论 | 决定/下一步 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `loop-041` | `PIVOTED` | `PIVOTED` | Run134 HC/copy census and Run135 cache scatter map reveal no source-backed semantics-safe >=2ms edit. 126 cache scatters match SWA/compressed/indexer distinct writes by layer; clone device attribution is inconclusive. The larger remaining exposed HCCL/phase skew needs causal analysis before implementation. |
| `loop-042` | `PIVOTED` | `PIVOTED` | Run137 host phase skew narrows during target and reappears after proposer, but latest-rank cadence ~54ms and no safe scheduler edit show skew alone is not a removable critical-path claim. Run140 identifies a concrete CPU-heavy eager DSpark path, directing next product-specific audit there. |
| `loop-043` | `PIVOTED` | `PIVOTED` | Run142 legal eight-rank segment timing shows the smallest safe replay boundary (Markov tail) has only ~0.695ms device interval; its 2.655ms Host work appears largely overlapped with target. Whole DSpark graph requires dynamic KV/metadata semantics and remains unproven. No high-value exposed DSpark replay candidate currently justifies implementation versus the ~46.6ms target stage. |
| `loop-044` | `PIVOTED` | `PIVOTED` | Target-stage families were decomposed through Run143-152: GMM reads active W4 weights at about 1TB/s in one-card product-shape counters, peer wait dominates apparent HCCL variation, DSA compressor calls are distinct, and small mixed-dtype allGather pairs have no large direct saving. No semantics-safe >=5ms target edit is established. Run153 identifies a larger unlocalized first-token E2E range, so pivot to E2E boundary attribution. |
| `loop-045` | `PIVOTED` | `PIVOTED` | Legal diagnostics localize pre-handoff wall to prefill _model_forward, with one profiled call showing Host submission pacing; no safe removable prefill edit or formal E2E gain yet. Tail parked-slot fraction is 18.525%, but source-safe compaction remains unproven. Move to exact-state prefill execution feasibility. |
| `loop-046` | `PIVOTED` | `PIVOTED` | Exact-state prefill graph has no within-cohort shape reuse; existing DSA CP graph rejects prefill. Legal250/500ms Core admission holds aggregate requests but yield no material net diagnostic envelope gain and worsen or preserve four prefill calls. No correctness-gated formal E2E-worthy candidate. Return to dominant ~46.56ms target and inactive-slot tail. |
| `loop-047` | `PIVOTED` | `PIVOTED` | Run175 tail has 122 partial cycles but Run180 matched same-service Stock target-size event screen gives only 0.471-0.602s/cohort before substantial c12 ABI packing and state costs; direct Extreme benefit unproven and broad implementation has low expected product value relative to prefill Host work |
| `loop-048` | `PIVOTED` | `PIVOTED` | Run186 shows prefill forward thread CPU near wall but no concrete removable inner-layer fraction; Run188 proves full-cohort consolidation from7/8 to1 prefill call after1.089s wait yet only0.163s diagnostic envelope improvement vs no-wait A/A2 mean, with32 extra decode cycles. No justified formal E2E or KEEP candidate. |
| `loop-049` | `PIVOTED` | `PIVOTED` | Run190 finds static expert_map execution/weight-loader mismatch needing substantial correctness integration. Run191 fixed-map pair-swap simulation over two captured cycles gains57/78 active reads in sample but only+3/-1 on the other cycle; no robust transferable reduction. Run189 ideal2.0-2.2ms/cycle is unattainable arithmetic, and separate-service GMM rank spread<0.45ms. Deprioritize placement; no code or formal E2E. |
| `loop-050` | `EVALUATING` | `PENDING` | 审查 Run run192 的证据，并判断是否需要更多 Run |
